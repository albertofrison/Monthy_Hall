# This project implements a Monte Carlo method to solve the Monthy Hall Problem
# The Problem: Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats.
# You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat.
# He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?
